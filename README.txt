The modeling of many Hamiltonian systems, such as pendulums in physics, predator-prey dynamics in biology, particle motion in solid-state physics, and motion of stars in astronomy, is of scientific interest for the descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis of dynamical systems. Neural networks are universal function approximations that can learn the dynamics of continuous dynamical systems, including Hamiltonian systems. Furthermore, the neural network of a dynamical system can be informed of its invariances to improve its modeling. One invariance that is common in Hamiltonian systems is periodicity. We propose several methods to embed periodicity in neural networks. We compare their performance on interpolating and extrapolating the dynamical system. Our methods can reduce the error in extrapolating the Hamiltonian from $10$ to less than $0.1$ and the error in extrapolating the vector field from $100$ to less than $1$.
